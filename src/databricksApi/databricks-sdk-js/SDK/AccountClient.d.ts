     * This feature is in Public Preview. This feature works with all account ID

     *
     * Log delivery works with all account types. However, if your account is on the
     * E2 version of the platform or on a select custom plan that allows multiple
     * workspaces per account, you can optionally configure different storage
     * destinations for each workspace. Log delivery status is also provided to know
     * the latest status of log delivery attempts. The high-level flow of billable
     * usage delivery:
     *
     * 1. **Create storage**: In AWS, [create a new AWS S3 bucket] with a specific
     * bucket policy. Using Databricks APIs, call the Account API to create a
     * [storage configuration object](#operation/create-storage-config) that uses the
     * bucket name. 2. **Create credentials**: In AWS, create the appropriate AWS IAM
     * role. For full details, including the required IAM role policies and trust
     * relationship, see [Billable usage log delivery]. Using Databricks APIs, call
     * the Account API to create a [credential configuration
     * object](#operation/create-credential-config) that uses the IAM role's ARN. 3.
     * **Create log delivery configuration**: Using Databricks APIs, call the Account
     * API to [create a log delivery
     * configuration](#operation/create-log-delivery-config) that uses the credential
     * and storage configuration objects from previous steps. You can specify if the
     * logs should include all events of that log type in your account (_Account
     * level_ delivery) or only events for a specific set of workspaces (_workspace
     * level_ delivery). Account level log delivery applies to all current and future
     * workspaces plus account level logs, while workspace level log delivery solely
     * delivers logs related to the specified workspaces. You can create multiple
     * types of delivery configurations per account.
     *
     * For billable usage delivery: * For more information about billable usage logs,
     * see [Billable usage log delivery]. For the CSV schema, see the [Usage page]. *
     * The delivery location is `<bucket-name>/<prefix>/billable-usage/csv/`, where
     * `<prefix>` is the name of the optional delivery path prefix you set up during
     * log delivery configuration. Files are named
     * `workspaceId=<workspace-id>-usageMonth=<month>.csv`. * All billable usage logs
     * apply to specific workspaces (_workspace level_ logs). You can aggregate usage
     * for your entire account by creating an _account level_ delivery configuration
     * that delivers logs for all current and future workspaces in your account. *
     * The files are delivered daily by overwriting the month's CSV file for each
     * workspace.
     *
     * For audit log delivery: * For more information about about audit log delivery,
     * see [Audit log delivery], which includes information about the used JSON
     * schema. * The delivery location is
     * `<bucket-name>/<delivery-path-prefix>/workspaceId=<workspaceId>/date=<yyyy-mm-dd>/auditlogs_<internal-id>.json`.
     * Files may get overwritten with the same content multiple times to achieve
     * exactly-once delivery. * If the audit log delivery configuration included
     * specific workspace IDs, only _workspace-level_ audit logs for those workspaces
     * are delivered. If the log delivery configuration applies to the entire account
     * (_account level_ delivery configuration), the audit log delivery includes
     * workspace-level audit logs for all workspaces in the account as well as
     * account-level audit logs. See [Audit log delivery] for details. * Auditable
     * events are typically available in logs within 15 minutes.
